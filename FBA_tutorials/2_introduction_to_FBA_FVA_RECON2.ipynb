    "The next key component of the model is the \"medium\", i.e. the set of metabolites that is allowed to be taken up into the cell.

    "## Performing Flux Balance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is FBA again?\n",
    "We will use the constraint-based modeling technique called flux balance analysis (FBA) (http://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1614). Given the metabolic network this method computationally calculates the flux distribution, meaning the fluxes through all reactions in the model at steady-state, that is optimal according to a specified objective function. In our case, the objective function will usually be the flux through the biomass reaction. This reaction contains (when known) experimentally determined ratio's of metabolites that make of the composition of a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "FBA has traditionally been applied to metabolism as we are doing here. FBA primarily makes use of the stoichiometry matrix $S$. This matrix is of size $m \\times r$ where $m$ is the number of species or metabolites in the system and $r$ is the number of reactions. Every row of $S$ specifies for a specific metabolite in what quantity it partakes in each reaction. Therefore, each element $(i,j)$ of $S$ contains the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite $i$ in reaction $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word flux is used to describe a reaction rate at steady state. In FBA the aim is to find the flux distributions of the network that satisfy (1) the steady-state condition, this is based on the assumption that metabolism occurs on a fast time-scale compared to gene regulatory events and thus reaction rates are constant, (2) thermodynamic feasibility , i.e. some reactions are known to be irreversible, (3) maximal flux constraints when these are known and (4) maximize some objective like growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "### For the brave\n",
    "Mathematically, this can be concisely summarized as\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{Maximize } Z &=c^T v, \\text{ such that } \\\\\n",
    "Sv &= 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\alpha_k \\leq & ~ v_k \\leq \\beta_k, \\text{ for all k}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Here $Z$ is the objective, $c$ is a column vector with coefficients for reactions in the objecte, $v$ is the column vector of fluxes representing all reactions in the model. As such $c^T v$ is a linear combination of fluxes, the objective. $S$ is the stoichiometry matrix, $\\alpha_k$ is the lower bound for reaction $k$ and similarly $\\beta_k$ is the upper bound for reaction $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be thought of as first constraining all possible solutions to the ones that allow a steady state and satisfy the bounds ( this results in a multi dimensional cone within the null space of S) and then finding the optimal solution among the remaining degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will do\n",
    "We will perform in-silico experiments with genetic manipulations by changing the third line in the above equation, i.e. the lower and upper bounds for the reactions. By setting both the lower bound $\\alpha_k$ and the upper bound $\\beta_k$ to zero we in effect knock out a reaction. Similarly, by setting it to a specific value we can fix a certain flux level for a specific reaction.\n",
